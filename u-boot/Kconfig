config LOCALVERSION
	string "Local version - append to U-Boot release"
	depends on !SPL_BUILD
	help
	  Append an extra string to the end of your U-Boot version.
	  This will show up on your boot log, for example.
	  The string you set here will be appended after the contents of
	  any files with a filename matching localversion* in your
	  object and source tree, in that order.  Your total string can
	  be a maximum of 64 characters.

config LOCALVERSION_AUTO
	bool "Automatically append version information to the version string"
	depends on !SPL_BUILD
	default y
	help
	  This will try to automatically determine if the current tree is a
	  release tree by looking for git tags that belong to the current
	  top of tree revision.

	  A string of the format -gxxxxxxxx will be added to the localversion
	  if a git-based tree is found.  The string generated by this will be
	  appended after any matching localversion* files, and after the value
	  set in CONFIG_LOCALVERSION.

	  (The actual string used here is the first eight characters produced
	  by running the command:

	    $ git rev-parse --verify HEAD

	  which is done within the script "scripts/setlocalversion".)

config CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE
	bool "Optimize for size"
	depends on !SPL_BUILD
	default y
	help
	  Enabling this option will pass "-Os" instead of "-O2" to gcc
	  resulting in a smaller U-Boot image.

	  This option is enabled by default for U-Boot.

menuconfig EXPERT
        bool "Configure standard U-Boot features (expert users)"
        help
          This option allows certain base U-Boot options and settings
          to be disabled or tweaked. This is for specialized
          environments which can tolerate a "non-standard" U-Boot.
          Only use this if you really know what you are doing.

config FIT
	bool "Support Flattened Image Tree"
	depends on !SPL_BUILD
	help
	  This option allows to boot the new uImage structrure,
	  Flattened Image Tree.  FIT is formally a FDT, which can include
	  images of various types (kernel, FDT blob, ramdisk, etc.)
	  in a single blob.  To boot this new uImage structure,
	  pass the the address of the blob to the "bootm" command.

config FIT_VERBOSE
	bool "Display verbose messages on FIT boot"
	depends on FIT

config FIT_SIGNATURE
	bool "Enabel signature verification of FIT uImages"
	depends on FIT
	help
	  This option enables signature verification of FIT uImages,
	  using a hash signed and verified using RSA.
	  See doc/uImage.FIT/signature.txt for more details.

config SYS_EXTRA_OPTIONS
	string "Extra Options (DEPRECATED)"
	depends on !SPL_BUILD
	help
	  The old configuration infrastructure (= mkconfig + boards.cfg)
	  provided the extra options field. If you have something like
	  "HAS_BAR,BAZ=64", the optional options
	    #define CONFIG_HAS
	    #define CONFIG_BAZ	64
	  will be defined in include/config.h.
	  This option was prepared for the smooth migration from the old
	  configuration to Kconfig. Since this option will be removed sometime,
	  new boards should not use this option.

config SYS_TEXT_BASE
	depends on SPARC
	hex "Text Base"
	help
	  TODO: Move CONFIG_SYS_TEXT_BASE for all the architecture
